# GIF-Search
This app utilizes the GIPHY API to allow the user to define some feeling/emotion as a button
and then to load up to 10 .gifs at a time based on that search on each button click.

The .gifs also contain ratings for displaying the most widely appropriate content for an audience.

An API Key is included in the code to initialize GIPHY.

Please contact Peter at https://github.com/psmith1 if you have questions about this project. He currently maintains the repository and monitors any contributions.

Enjoy!
